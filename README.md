# MuteTimerBot

A simple Discord bot that will server mute you after a specified amount of time.
If you're wondering what the use-case is, have you ever wanted to stay in a call without
worrying about your alarms waking someone up? Well, with this bot you can simply tell
it when to server mute you so that the other people in the call won't hear your alarm.

The one that comes up to me is if you're in a call with your SO and do not want them to
also wake up from your alarm, this is perfect for you.

You can use [this](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1329398790121193526&permissions=4194304&integration_type=0&scope=bot) link to invite the bot to your server.
